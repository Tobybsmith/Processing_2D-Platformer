This is a 2D platformer that is being designed in Processing. There is like maybe a template here but the groundwork exists. 
The collisions are awful and the gameplay is like mediocre at best but it's done in processing so thats cool.
All the files that aren't Game.pde are objects and need to stay in the same folder. The code is in Game.pde
It is spaghetti garbage so please don't waste time fixing or optimizing it.
Enjoy
